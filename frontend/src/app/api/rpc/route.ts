/**
 * Same-origin relay for the Studionet JSON-RPC endpoint.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Not because Studio lacks CORS. It reflects whatever `Origin` you send and
 * answers preflights correctly. The failure is rate limiting wearing a CORS
 * costume. Studio meters per IP, and once the quota is gone it answers with a
 * bare 429 that carries **no** `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`:
 *
 *     HTTP/2 429
 *     retry-after: 60
 *     {"error":{"code":-32029,"message":"Rate limit exceeded: ..."}}
 *
 * A response the browser is not allowed to read is reported as a CORS
 * violation, not as the 429 it is — so an exhausted quota shows up in the
 * console as "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present". Same
 * message you would get from a genuinely closed endpoint, entirely different
 * cause, and no amount of CORS configuration fixes it.
 *
 * Server-to-server fetch has no same-origin policy, so relaying through here
 * makes the browser see this route's own response — status, body and all.
 * That does not raise the quota. It makes hitting it legible: the app gets
 * "rate limited, retry in Ns" instead of a phantom CORS error.
 *
 * Bradbury does not need this. It serves CORS headers on errors too, so the
 * browser talks to it directly — see `rpcUrl()` in `lib/genlayer.ts`.
